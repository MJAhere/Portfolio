                About Me
            </h1>
            <p class=text>
                First, let me start off by saying that I am a professional. I will always be reliable and put the best interest of the user/customer first. I have 5 years of experience as a building engineer in downtown Denver. During that time I learned a multitude of valuable life lessons and gained a tool box full of reusable knowledge and expertise. As a Building Engineer, you are forced to sink or swim in high pressure situations. Whether a HVAC system goes down or the building floods, I learned to be ready for anything and work with the situation to create the best possible out come. Problem solving and critical thinking are two of my highest skills. Working long hours under pressure is where I thrive and being prepared and organized is how I do so. I can tell you with confidence that I might be the most reliable and driven person you will ever meet. My attitude remains solid and my passion for my work is exponential and will grow as the project grows and changes. Being challenged is what I look forward too and being able to bring my employer value on the first day and every day following is what I strive for. I have spent just over a year now programming and learning languages. I have solid knowledge in back end and front end web development. I have learned HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap and other front end frameworks. In the back end, I am knowledgeable in Node.js, React, MySQL and will continue to learn more and more. If there is something that i may not know that is used in a specific job, I am always up for the task to learn and do what it takes to complete the job. I can learn quickly and stay productive while doing so.
